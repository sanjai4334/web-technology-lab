            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Our application showcases the power and flexibility of Angular. Angular is a platform for building mobile
                and desktop web applications. With Angular, you can scale from single-developer projects to
                enterprise-level applications.</p>

        <article class="getting-started">
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>Getting started with Angular is easy. The Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) streamlines the
                development process by providing commands for generating components, services, and other parts of your
                application. Here’s a simple example:</p>
            <pre>
          <code>
            ng new my-app
            cd my-app
            ng serve
          </code>
        </pre>
